# TruncatedNormal

A collection of functions to deal with the truncated univariate and multivariate normal
distributions, including

* generator of independent and identically distributed random vectors from the
  truncated univariate and multivariate distributions;
* (Quasi-) Monte Carlo estimator and a deterministic upper bound of the
  cumulative distribution function of the multivariate normal;
* algorithm for the accurate computation of the quantile function of the normal
  distribution in the extremes of its tails.
